## 🎯 Our Goals on GitHub

### 1. **Multilingual Montessori Assessment Tools**
We're developing assessment frameworks based on:
- **Assessment *for*, *as*, and *of* learning** ([WNCP framework](https://www.edu.gov.mb.ca/ks4/assess/index.html))
- Differentiation across three languages
- Inclusive design to detect and support learners with dyslexia and differentiated learning abilities.

👉 `#assessments` folder will host:
- Formative rubrics
- Printable checklists
- Self-assessment tools
- Open-source multilingual diagnostics
- Guide training diagnostics
- Project Based Learning (PBL) tools

### 2. **Self-Guided Learning Tools**
We're prototyping **low-bandwidth**, **AI-powered** digital tools for:
- **Montessori shelf simulations**
- Literacy via **Sound Step phonics** levels in English, French and Malagasy
- Geography, History, Science and Literature experiences
- **Intro to Programming** through storytelling, block-based coding, and Scratch-like interfaces

👉 Future repos: 
- `Montessori-LMS`
- `Letter-Box-App`
- `Montessori-Maker-Kit` (DIY, local-materials-friendly)

## 🤖 Why AI + GitHub?

We believe technology can extend the reach of trained Montessori guides, especially where:
- Teachers lack deep subject knowledge (SME)
- Classrooms are **multi-age** and under-resourced
- Students are ready for **self-paced, autonomous learning**

We're exploring:
- AI-generated lesson scaffolding
- Natural language multilingual assessments
- Custom LLMs for "ask the Guide" experiences

## 🌱 Collaborate With Us!

We're a small team with big dreams. We welcome:
- Open-source contributors passionate about **Montessori & equity**
- Educators building multilingual content
- Devs with experience in **edtech, NLP, and localization**
